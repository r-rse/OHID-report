## Setting `wd`

Getting an error straight away when trying to source `launch.R` as

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("launch.R")
#> ##------ Mon Sep 19 13:00:30 2022 ------##
#> Launching SPHERE Modelling Platform on dcs33297
#> Error in setwd(wd_path) : cannot change working directory
```

It looks like you are trying to set the working directory as the parent of `launch.R`? This seems a really brittle approach. It's mcuh better to avoid setting working directories and rather assume all processes will be performed in the root of the directory and use relative paths from the root for everything else.

I had to comment `setwd(wd_path)` out.

If this MUST be used (which should be extremely rare), it is best to use `on.exit(setwd(here::here()))` to ensure the wd is reset in case of an error.

### Setting up data access

It took me quite some time to figure out that there is hidden structure expected.

I had placed the sqlite database in a given folder, let's say the Desktops (`~/Desktop`) for illustrative purposes and changed the value of `HPC_datapath` in `private.csv` to `~/Desktop` .

However the code expects a folder the same name as the value of `LiveProject_db` in which the database should be contained (i.e. the actual path to the database was being assigned to `data_dir` as `~/Documents/workflows/OHID/data/Y063_SynthMod` and the full path resolving to `"~/Documents/workflows/OHID/data/Y063_SynthMod/Y103_SynthMod_dev.db"` . This is both unexpected and somewhat undocumented. Checking that the path actually resolved to a database file with an informative error that actually prints the path where the data is expected would have helped a lot.

### Loading dependencies from csv files

The practice is not best practice and brittle for a number of reasons:

Necessity to manually track dependencies when this can be automated with `renv`. Changes to the local library can be captured with `renv::snapshot()` while dependencies required for scripts in a particular directory can be identified with `renv::dependencies()`. If you did need to load a whole bunch of packages for a module you could use: .

```{r}
renv::dependencies()$Package |> 
    unique() |> 
    lapply(require, character.only = TRUE)
```

Even better would be to clean up afterwards with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
module_deps <- renv::dependencies()$Package |> 
    unique() 

lapply(module_deps, require, character.only = TRUE)

# MODULE CODE

lapply(paste0("package:", module_deps), detach, character.only = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

However the order in which dependencies are unlinked become important and errors might be thrown if a package which is a dependency of another loaded package is attempted to be detached first while forcing detachment with `force = TRUE` might compromise the functioning of other packages unrelated to the module.

In any case, all this can be avoided by not loading and unloading packages which pollutes the search path. Instead it is STRONGLY recommended that functions are called using the `::` operator. Performance gains are not worth the problems having so many packages loaded introduces, makes the function namespace explicit in the code. A few key packages like `dplyr` that are used heavily throughout can be loaded.

### Missing variables in `meta_DistributionVariables` table.

I'm using the default attribute in `user-input.R` list:

    Birthdate BinaryCHD BinaryCKD BinaryColC BinaryPA BinaryPIA BinaryStroke BinaryT2DM Binary5PD BMIPercentile DeathCause EthGrp HLQ IMDDecile Income LTLA19 NSSEC RBAC11 RUC11 SBPPercentile Sex SexualOrientation TTWDistance TTWMethod

However, `IMDDecile` does not exist in the `meta_DistributionVariables` in `Y103_SynthMod_dev.db` and `create-variable-groupings.R` fails with a not very informative error which does not prompt user on what needs rectifying. Ideally this could be handled automatically (i.e. the attribute ignored and a warning issued to the user to inform them) or at the very least, an error which directs the user to the `user-inputs.R` to change the setting for `IMDDecile` to `FALSE` . In any case it feels like this should have been checked earlier and more formally.

### Using system `unix` to detect HPC brittle

Working on a mac which evaluates to a `unix` system, `launch.R` would quit on me at the end of the session even in interactive mode.

### NOMIS data problem

The NOMIS query returns `NA` results

```{r}
structure(list(GEOGRAPHY_CODE = c("E06000005", "E06000005", "E06000005", 
"E06000005", "E06000005", "E06000005", "E06000005", "E06000047", 
"E06000047", "E06000047", "E06000047", "E06000047", "E06000047",

NA, NA, NA)), row.names = c(NA, -20L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", 
"data.frame"))
```

here's the full response

I also tried to download the data manually

and got similarly empty results

## Questions

-   Why S4

-   Why `eval(substitute))` when loading S4 methods

-   Why no signature on S4 methods

-   Are overrides by `hpc_mode = TRUE` important?
